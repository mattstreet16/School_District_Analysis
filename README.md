#### School District Analysis
Using Juypter Notebook to Analyze School District Data 
--------

### Overview of the school district analysis
Maria, chief data scientist for a city school district has tasked me with the analysis of a local school district. She sent me a file containing student, and told me to use Python and Juypternote to further anaylize the data and compare test scores of schools within the district. After cleaning and analyzing the scores and completeing the district analysis, it was uncovered that some 9th graders at Thomas High had tampered with test scores and Maria challenged me to correct the data by replacing the falsified scores were replaced with 'NaN', and comparing the results.
